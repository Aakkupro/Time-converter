# Time Converter App

This is a simple web-based Time Converter App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to effortlessly convert time between 12-hour (AM/PM) and 24-hour formats.

## Features

- **HTML:**
    - Uses semantic HTML elements for structure (e.g., `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<label>`, `<input>`, `<button>`, `<div>`).
    - Includes a clear and concise form for user input.
    - Displays results dynamically using JavaScript.
- **CSS:**
    - Implements a visually appealing and responsive design.
    - Utilizes a background image to enhance the user interface.
    - Ensures readability and a clean layout.
- **JavaScript:**
    - Provides dynamic functionality for time conversion.
    - Validates user input to prevent errors.
    - Displays clear error messages for invalid input.
    - Updates the results area dynamically based on user actions.
    - Converts Time on Button Click or Pressing Enter key.

## Functionality

- The app takes a time input from the user in either 12-hour (with AM/PM) or 24-hour format.
- It validates the input to ensure it adheres to the correct format.
- If the input is valid, it converts the time to the other format (12-hour to 24-hour or vice-versa).
- The converted time is then displayed in the results area.
- If the input is invalid, the app shows a clear error message to the user, guiding them to enter the time in the correct format.

## How to Use

1. Enter the time you want to convert in the input field.
2. Make sure to include AM/PM for 12-hour format or use the 24-hour format.
3. Click the "Convert" button or press Enter.
4. The converted time will be displayed below the button.
